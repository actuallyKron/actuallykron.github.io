<h2> Long Tutorials (04/09/2024)</h2>
<p>
  When I was first learning Godot so many of the tutorials that I watched were long, way too drawn out and made me want to bang my head against a wall before the topic of the video was even covered.
  I don't really see the need for a tutorial to be nothing but straight to the point. It's even annoying when people introduce themselves. No one cares, get to the point and teach me what I want to know.
  If you've ever thought about making tutorials, respect the viewer's time. You probably won't benefit as much as yourself but you'll be helping out a whole lot of people in the long run. 
  I'm not trying to be mean, I just dislike long pointless waffle in tutorial videos.
