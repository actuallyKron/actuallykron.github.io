<h2> Washing Machine Game (04/06/2025)</h2>
<p>Game Idea: you play as a washing machine.  don't know what the gameplay would be but I imagine it being 3D, third person and with PS1 style graphics. That's kinda it. thx bye</p>

<h2>Bought Bloodshed yesterday (04/06/2025)</h2>
<p>I bought <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747550/Bloodshed/" target="_blank" >Bloodshed</a> yesterday as it was on sale (it was 55% off, what a bargain) and wow it's great. 
  The best way to desribe it is Vampire Survivors if it was a boomer shooter. 
  I really liked VS so it's no suprise that I really like this game too. If you like VS, I would recommend this game. 
  Maybe I'll write a full write up about my thoughts on this at some point. </p>

<h2> Blocking Blue Checkmark Accounts (09/09/2024)</h2>
<p>
  For some reason, there's a bunch of people on Twitter who will block accounts that have blue checkmarks. There's even a browser extension that will do it for you. I just don't understand this.
  For those people who don't use twitter, if you have a blue checkmark it generally means you paid for premium. I don't really see any problem with this. You pay money, and get some benefits in return.
  The biggest one being the visibility boost.
</p>
<p>
  I've seen people say they block accounts because they don't like people who have supported Twitter.
  I don't understand this either as just by being on the platform you're also supporting Twitter. You're viewing ads, engaging in posts, posting yourself and giving the platform more content to profit from.
  Also the people paying for premium aren't doing it to support Twitter, they're doing it for the benefits they get in return. If you're trying to market your game, it makes sense to pay money to get more eyes on your content.
</p>
<p>
  I've also seen people say it's because blue checkmark accounts are genrally just spammers and shit posters. I get this, I've blocked some accounts for these reasons, but only
  after they've annoyed me, not because they have a blue checkmark.
</p>
<p>
  I follow some blue checkmark accounts on Twitter that post some great game dev content. Imagine if I had a browser extension that would've just blocked all of those accounts. 
  I would've missed out on a bunch of good stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe I'm missing something but to me blocking accounts just because they've paid for premium is honestly a little silly and I think you're missing out on great content and hurting the creator way more than you're hurting Twitter.
  If I have missed something, please do reach out and educate me,<a href="https://twitter.com/actuallykron", target="_blank"><em><b> @actuallykron</b></em></a>

<h2> Long Tutorials (04/09/2024)</h2>
<p>
  When I was first learning Godot so many of the tutorials that I watched were long, way too drawn out and made me want to bang my head against a wall before the topic of the video was even covered.
  I don't really see the need for a tutorial to be nothing but straight to the point. It's even annoying when people introduce themselves. No one cares, get to the point and teach me what I want to know.
  If you've ever thought about making tutorials, respect the viewer's time. You probably won't benefit as much yourself but you'll be helping out a whole lot of people in the long run. 
  I'm not trying to be mean, I just dislike long pointless waffle in tutorial videos.
